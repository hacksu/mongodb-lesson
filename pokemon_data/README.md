pokedex-raw.json comes from [fanzeyi/pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json). pokedex.json is a version that is transformed so the schema matches the lesson structure. If setting up a MongoDB database server for this lesson in the future, place the contents of pokedex.json in a collection called pokedex in a database called pokemon. (MongoDBCompass makes this really easy, it prompts you to import json files when viewing empty collections.) extra_pc_pokemon.json contains pokemon individuals that can be imported into the PC collection if you want to try the battling game but there are no documents inserted into it.
